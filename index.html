        <p>Hello! My name is Caleb Freed and I am a student at Thinkful!</p>
        <p>Here are some reasons why I chose the Thinkful Software Engineering Botocamp:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The posted graduation statistics showed former students had success here</li>
            <li>The reviews found online were mostly positive </li>
            <li>They had a nice UI! lol</li>
      </ul>
        <p>I am located in Washington state, a rainy, cold, and beautful place in the PNW.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div>
        <p>I am 24 years old and marred to Jenny, my beautiful wife. We have a child on the way and I cannot wait to be a father! </p>
        <p>The reason I am so thrilled to be learning about web devlopment is becuase I have met and worked with some Amazon software engineers at my current company and they have inspired me to work hard at this course to one day be apart of a great team like i have now!</p>
        <p>Here are the top three reasons I am wanting to switch my career to Software Engineering:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The creative challenge it provides</li>
          <li>The opportunity to provide more for my family</li>
          <li>It has always been a dream in the back of my mind!</li>
        </ol>
